## Build

The library itself does not need to be built, but documentation generation and example configuration has been automated with grunt.

```
$ npm install && grunt
```

This will ensure that all of the necessary node modules are installed, documentation is built, and the example has been bootstrapped.

Once this is done you may launch `example/index.html` in your browser.
